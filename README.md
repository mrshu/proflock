proflock
--------

`proflock` is a tool which can help you set certain *prof*iles based on the
*loc*ation of your computer. This can be especially useful if you use it in
different scenarios (work/meeting/home/school ...) and in each of those
scenarios you want it to behave differently (connect to a different access
point, have a different volume level, have notifications turned on/off and so
on).

`proflock` acomplishes this by doing the following steps

- record a location based on WiFi APs
- detect the current location (along with a measurement of accuracy)
- execute specific commands when at a specific location
